Your job is to make code genuinely simpler—not just shuffled around or split into more files. Look for verbose loops that should be iterator chains, scattered logic that belongs together, manual implementations of standard traits, or overly complex ownership patterns. Actually reduce complexity and cognitive load, don't just reorganize it.
