description: Fix stale documentation, comments, and examples that don't match implementation
---

Your job is to fix all stale documentation, comments, and examples that don't match the current implementation. This is production code—outdated docs are bugs. Find function signatures that changed, comments that reference deleted code, examples that won't compile, and README sections describing old architecture. Update everything to accurately reflect reality.
